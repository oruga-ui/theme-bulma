# Raising an Issue

- Make sure the issue hasn't been raised yet
- Include **screenshots** or animated GIFs in your issue whenever needed (if visual issue)

# Submitting a Pull Request

- Before you start working, it's better to open an issue to discuss first.
- The current developed version is in the `main` branch. The theme does not have a dedicated `develop` branch
- Include **screenshots** or animated GIFs in your pull request whenever needed (if visual changes)
- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - we will let GitHub automatically squash it before merging
- **DO NOT** commit the `dist` folder, use it only for testing on your end
- If adding new feature:
    - Provide convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it

## Oruga Sass styleguide

- **Always on a separated file** in `/src/scss/components`
- **Use .scss extension**
- **Use kebab-case**

### Transitions / Animations GPU-based only

The only properties that uses hardware acceleration are:

- transform
- opacity
- filter

These are two great articles about it: https://medium.com/outsystems-experts/how-to-achieve-60-fps-animations-with-css3-db7b98610108 and https://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-to-hardware-acceleration-css-animations/.

# Development Setup

The local setup contains every example of the main Oruga documentation page.

To link the main Oruga packages locally, build both the `oruga` and the `examples` package in the Oruga repo.  
Then run `npm run link ../oruga/packages/oruga ../oruga/packages/examples` in the theme repo to link the build output of the main Oruga packages.
